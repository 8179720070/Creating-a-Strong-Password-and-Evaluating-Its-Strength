## Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
- Use at least 12 characters.

- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.

- Avoid dictionary words, names, or keyboard patterns (e.g., "qwerty").

- Use a passphrase (e.g., "T1me2_Eat!Pizza@9PM") â€“ long but memorable.

- Change passwords regularly, especially for critical accounts.
  
## Tips Learned from Evaluation
- Passwords with randomness and variety in character types perform best.

- Adding symbols and increasing length dramatically increases password strength.

- Tools provide valuable feedback to identify weak components.

- Memorable passphrases with complexity are best for security and usability.

## Common Password Attacks 

#### Attack Type	               #### Description
- Brute Force	                Tries all combinations until correct password is found. Slower but guaranteed over time.
- Dictionary Attack	          Uses lists of common words and passwords to guess quickly. Effective against simple passwords.
- Credential Stuffing       	Uses leaked usernames/passwords to try on other services.
Phishing	Tricks users into giving up passwords.
- Keylogging	                Malware captures keystrokes.

## Password Complexity & Security
- Longer, more complex passwords are exponentially harder to crack.
- For example, an 8-character password might take minutes to hours to brute force; a 16-character password with variety could take centuries.
- Complexity and randomness reduce vulnerability to dictionary and brute-force attacks.
